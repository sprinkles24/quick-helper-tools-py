# Permutation Calculator

This is a permutation calculator! Users can input any amount of terms, and the program will output every possible pair. It detects the use of "&" and "+", and tries to avoid using them to put pairs together if they are also found in the user's terms. This program was coded in python using PyCharm.

I haven't used Python in a while, so made this simple project to get back into it. I struggled with implementing findConcatenatingTerm(listWithStrings), the function that either asks the user or automatically chooses "+", "&", or "and" to show a pair of terms. This function goes through each character in each term in the list of terms, and keeps track of the amount of "+" or "&" characters. Originally, I also wanted to check for "and" in the terms, but this proved difficult and I ended up foregoing that feature to favor completing this project, seeing as its main goal was for me to review Python.
